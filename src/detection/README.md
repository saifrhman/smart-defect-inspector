# Detection (YOLOv8)

This module will handle defect detection (bounding boxes).

Planned scripts:
- `train_yolo.py`   Train YOLOv8 on a defect dataset
- `infer_yolo.py`   Run inference and save overlays
- `export_onnx.py`  Optional: export model for deployment

For now we start with a lightweight scaffold so the repo structure is complete.
